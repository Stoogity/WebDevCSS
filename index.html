            <p id="explain">With this kind of crack, referred to as a handcrack, the climber ascends by flattening their hand and tucking the thumb into the palm to make the hand a little thicker. This allows the climber to get their hand temporarily stuck in the crack. As for the feet, the climber turns the knee out to make the foot thinner, then slots their foot into the crack before twisting the knee back inward. This creates a base for the climber to stand on. In this case, the same technique is applied but only in order to take weight off of the hands and give the climber something to push off of.</p>
